# Python opencv examples

This repo contains some pratical examples we've expirencied on my 
stduies cases over OpenCV pythom module. This is to my own consult later too.

On the examples folder examples there are some pratical, basic and simple exemple of using ```opencv-python``` library. We can improve this example by visting OpenCV Site to get more information to build more complex tools that can auxiliar us in our tasks with video and image handler.

## With OpenCV Python what can we do?

1. Image processing;
2. Video Extract frames;
3. Video Exxtract clip;
4. Automations tasks on work video and image editing

And more...
